## Automation Meets Creativity

Speed is critical in testing, but quality sells. This engine solves the "quality vs speed" trade-off by using AI to generate professional-grade ad assets instantly.

Instead of manually writing copy and editing photos for every test, the system takes a raw product input and outputs a ready-to-launch Facebook CBO campaign.

## The AI Pipeline

1.  **Copywriting:** Uses GPT-4 to generate psychological hooks, scroll-stopping headlines, and benefits-driven descriptions tailored to the specific market language.
2.  **Visual Enhancement:** Uses image processing pipelines (Photoroom API + Custom Python Scripts) to remove messy backgrounds, center products, and apply conversion-optimized overlays.
3.  **Structure:** Automatically builds the JSON structure required by Facebook's Marketing API, including proper tracking parameters.
