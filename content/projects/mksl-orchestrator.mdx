## The Engine

Running a high-volume e-commerce operation requires precision timing and constant decision-making. Humans are slow and need sleep; **MKSL (Mkai Scale Launcher)** does not.

This orchestration engine is the central nervous system of my e-commerce infrastructure. It wakes up daily via cron jobs, analyzes market data, selects products based on complex confidence algorithms, and orchestrates the launch across multiple storefronts.

## Algorithmic Decision Making

The scheduler doesn't just "pick random products." It uses a tiered algorithmic strategy to maximize ROI:

1.  **Winner Expansion:** Identifies products generating high sales in one market and prioritizes them for launch in untap markets.
2.  **Visual Similarity Vector Search:** Uses RAG and vector embeddings (Qdrant) to find products visually similar to current top-performers (98% accuracy), betting on aesthetic trends.
3.  **New High-Potential:** Selects products that are visually *distinct* from current winners but have high external confidence scores, diversifying the portfolio.
4.  **Wildcard:** A diversity-injection algorithm that picks high-scoring but untested product categories to prevent catalog stagnation.

## Technical Highlights

*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** Built on **Node.js** and **BullMQ (Redis)** to handle thousands of concurrent jobs without blocking.
*   **Real-Time Communication:** Uses **Socket.IO** to push live updates to the frontend dashboard and **Telegram Bot API** for admin alerts.
*   **Confidence Scoring:** A proprietary mathematical model that aggregates data from scrapers and ad libraries to assign a `0-20` probability score to every product block.
